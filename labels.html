        <h2>Labels, Self-Definitions, and Perceptions</h2>

        <p class="essay-body">
            &emsp;&emsp;In high school, in order to register for IB (International Baccalaureate) exams, we were asked to fill out cards so that our personal information, including race as a demographic marker, could be input. I write down what I feel is the most
            concise and precise version of my race: “African American and white.” African American first because it is more prominent in my life despite that it is a lesser percentage of my genes. African American not black because black is a skin tone
            I don’t think I can claim. White not Caucasian because Caucasian is just an abstraction white Americans use, often without fully understanding why. I do not claim Chinese heritage like my father does because, though I know it’s there, it has
            no impact on my life. <br> &emsp;&emsp;A few days later, Ms. Patience seeks me out. <i>I’m not sure we can put down two different ethnicities. Which one would you prefer if we can only put one?</i> This is not the first time someone
            has asked me to choose between my parents; at age nine, my own mother asked me which I would choose in a situation like this. Ms. Patience has no answers for me on how selecting race works when the secretaries’ office registers us for tests.
            I find it hard to believe this issue has not come up and been dealt with before. My older sister must’ve done this three years before me. <i>Well, IB is an international program, so…</i> So, multiracial people are a uniquely American system
            glitch? I rank my preferences for her: <br>&emsp;1. Both African American and white <br>&emsp;2. Multiracial <br>&emsp;3. Nothing, left blank <br>&emsp;4. African American <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Although I know my mom would be upset for not acknowledging
            the half of me that comes from her, I choose my father’s side. I’m a good student and, cynically, I’d rather my test results be associated with defying stereotypes of black and African American people than with already-privileged white people.
            Today, I stand by this ranking and the choice my 17-year-old self made. <br>&emsp;&emsp;I can’t tell you the resolution to this story; I don’t know what was ultimately marked as my race. Now, though, I wonder why I cared so much. To me it
            increasingly feels that other people have just as much right to define me as I do. Perhaps it was only because I was given the opportunity to decide for myself that I took such lengths to get it “right;” however, I can also recall a moment
            sophomore year where I snuck into a classroom during lunch to correct an arbitrary form that listed only African American as my race. Throughout the semester, we’ve read from authors who find solace in being able to define themselves, usually
            in response to having a label put upon them by another. We’ve also read people’s experience confronting the way they are perceived by others, which I feel has great value as well. For the purposes of this paper, I’ll analyze the concepts of
            <i>self-definition</i> as the way a person chooses to identify themself and <i>perception</i> as the way other people label that person. These both have a place in all our lives, and it is important that we recognize the dual roles. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Where
            we encounter self-definition, we also often encounter a conflict with perception. In the “Too Black, Too Latino” episode of NPR’s Latino USA (<a href="#1">1</a>), host Maria Hinojosa interviews a number of people who identify as Afro-Latino.
            Many of them report colorism in Latino/a groups and their own families, who see lighter skin as preferable and wish to forget about the subjugation of black people throughout the Americas. One guest on the show, Jamila, tells a story about
            confronting her aunt with her discomfort with the use of the word “negra,” commonly used to indicate race in her home country of Panama. A young Jamila worried that it sounded like the n-word, so she was afraid to identify with it. This moment
            highlights the cultural divide between Jamila, growing up in the United States, and her Panamanian aunt, who is proud to be negra and doesn’t want to be washed out. Where Jamila perceives the word negatively because of the use of the n-word
            historically in the United States, her older aunt has come to take pride this definition of herself.<br>&emsp;&emsp;Ruth Behar, in “Temporary Latina” from the <i>Telling to Live</i> anthology, similarly explains her challenges in defining
            herself. Being of Jewish Cuban descent, she worries that she cannot call herself Latina because it might “take away the ‘real’ Latina identity of someone who needs to claim that identity for her very survival, self-preservation, and self-worth”
            (
            <a href="#2">2</a>). When talking to a colleague she recognizes that “she became a Latina the day she arrived on this side of the border” (234), but others—including the affirmative action definition of Latino/a, who told her that Jewish people
            cannot be hired as Latina and that Cubans are not a “needy Latin group”—cloud Behar’s definition of herself (232). Later though, she is considered Latina when the university needs an acting director of the Latino Studies program, highlighting
            and reinforcing the idea that her Latinidad is flexible and instantiated when convenient for others. Ultimately, it seems, Behar wants to self-define as Latina, but because of perceptions of her religion, light skin, and education, does not
            feel she can without qualification. Behar and the speakers in “Too Black, Too Latino” exemplify the difficulties faced when trying to create a definition of oneself according to one’s uncertain and complicated racial identity. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Through
            these texts, we can see the need and desire to define ourselves appropriately. Since we are reading published materials, there is also some need to publicize our self-definitions, to let others know who we are, beyond simply creating a definition
            in our own minds. A similar idea is brought about by Marta I. Cruz-Janzen’s “Latinegras: Desired Women - Undesirable Mothers, Daughters, Sisters, and Wives,” which tells about confrontations with racism and colorism toward Latinegras, “Latinas
            of obvious Black ancestry and undeniable ties to Africa” (<a href="#3">3</a>). The text deals with the complicated status of Afro-Latinos/as, as they struggle to fit in to any social group, are mocked for their skin and hair by their communities,
            deal with expectations of “marrying up” in order to “mejorar la raza,” and try to find and embrace their roots. Cruz-Janzen’s text begs the question of why a person defines themself by their race, ethnicity, or nationality – is it for themself
            or for others?
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;I recognize that I have a small privilege in not “looking like” or “fitting into” any of the groups people generally recognize. As a result, I am often asked to define myself via the clumsy question “<i>What, like, are you?</i>”
            In these interactions, I am given the unique opportunity to define myself when others might have a label imposed on them, such as described in Gabriel Haslip-Viera’s “Changing Identities: An Afro-Latin@ Family Portrait,” discussed later in
            this paper. Even for myself, I question why it is important for me to define myself to others. Disregarding people’s interest in knowing, should it matter to me that they define me the “right” way? In many ways I think the answer is no, because
            when the majority of my interactions with others do not revolve around race, my racial self-definition shouldn’t matter. On the other hand, as Vice President of Gonzaga’s Black Student Union last year, I was empowered to act as an ally and
            ambassador of the black, African, and African American community because of my African American heritage and given credibility from people’s knowledge of this heritage. There are situations in which I rely on others’ knowledge of my identity,
            so it does matter to me that I am perceived a certain way. Others too, then, must be in situations where the alignment between self-definition and perception is vital. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Throughout “Changing Identities: An Afro-Latin@ Family
            Portrait,” Gabriel Haslip-Viera recounts the various ways his and his family’s Latinidad has been perceived on government forms in the Caribbean and the U.S. By detailing nearly every variation imposed on his family, Haslip-Viera puts great
            emphasis on these perceptions, often as Negro, Colored, or White and less frequently as the most true, Puerto Rican. One instance included his grandfather’s military draft card for World War II, which listed him “as ‘White’ with ‘dark’ complexion”
            (
            <a href="#4">4</a>). Like the interviewees in “Too Black, Too Latino,” Haslip-Viera also tells about his family’s attempt to “mejorar la raza” through marriages and various communities that mocked darker-skinned people. In these ways, perception
            does have an important effect on people – physically in the war draft and emotionally with constant rejection. <br>&emsp;&emsp;Solange Knowles similarly details how perception can take a toll on bodies. Knowles, musical artist and sister of
            renowned singer Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, writes on her own experiences with perception of herself and her family in her essay "And Do You Belong? I Do" (<a href="#5">5</a>). This piece reflects on her experiences confronting racism even as
            a successful, black woman. Events include having food thrown at her while dancing with her family at a concert and being questioned by the police while driving in her own wealthy neighborhood. Regardless of self-definition, perception – specifically
            her perception as black – is what defines and drives these significant moments that ultimately drive an understanding of the author’s self and role. Knowles grows empowered in the face of racism, gaining confidence in knowing that “We Belong.
            We built this.” Unlike other texts, here perception and self-definition are aligned in recognizing African American heritage, and it is Knowles’ self-assuredness that stands in contrast with negative perceptions. <br>&emsp;&emsp;In Haslip-Viera
            and Knowles, we can see how perception plays a valid role in our lives because it controls how others treat us. I can recall many instances of being stared at in public, often when I’m out with my white mother and people are trying to determine
            our relationship, but also when I’m alone. Recently, I’ve been able to convince myself that it is my synthetic gray hair and eyebrow piercing that draw people to me, and this eases my discomfort with the attention. On the other hand, I know
            that I have been perceived as Puerto Rican and Hispanic (this term specifically chosen from encounters where people attempt to talk to me in Spanish), and I should let this perception drive the way I move through society and the way I define
            myself. It is important for me to recognize the way I’m perceived, and in this way others have a right to assert their perceptions of me. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, there are a number of roles that perception and self-definition play
            in our lives. We can try to control perception so that it aligns with our self-definition to give us credibility when necessary, as long as we first develop a definition of ourselves by which to stand. Finally, it is also important to understand
            perceived ideas of yourself in order to inform how you react to it. While an introspective and family-oriented self-definition is certainly an important part of building oneself, it is undeniable that perception changes us too and should be
            given similar consideration.
