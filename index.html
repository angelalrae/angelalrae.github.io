            <h1>Hello!</h1>
            <p>I'm Angela: a technical documentation writer who studied Computer Science, Environmental Studies, and Writing at Gonzaga University. I like cooking, gardening, thrift shopping, practicing pilates, and listening to podcasts. In addition, I
                am passionate about and motivated by the following three values:</p>

            <h1>Service creates community</h1>
            <p>My engagement with community service began in high school, going on the annual service trip through the Episcopal church I attended. In college, I continued in this spirit by going on Gonzaga's "Mission: Possible" (MP) alternative spring break
                trip, a program that sends students to sites around the country for a week of service. I participated in MP all four years, the last two as a trip leader. On these trips, I got hands on experience with environmental protection and social
                justice in national parks in San Francisco, CA; worked alongside Catholic Workers and adults with disabilies on a farm in Tacoma, WA; and learned about indigenous culture from the people of the Makah reservation in Neah Bay, WA.
                </br>
                </br>
                These trips were my favorite part of my college experience, especially as a leader where I could guide other students on their journey towards realizing the impact of working in community with others. I greatly value service work, and it was wonderful
                to go to a Jesuit university that prioritizes this. I documented my reflections in a <a href="https://medium.com/@angela.rae/self-serving-community-service-4cd8a5dc2dc" target="_blank">Medium post about the value of service immersion trips <img src="images/externallink-light.svg"></a>.
                I am currently volunteering with the youth back at my home church, and I hope at some point in my life to participate in post-graduate service through the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, City Year, Food Corps, or a similar program.

                <p style="width:100%;">In college, I experienced first-hand how we can use technology to support access to technology and information. As the web designer for
                    <a id="dhi-link" href="http://as-dh.gonzaga.edu/weaving-our-sisters-voices/" target="_blank">a site to communicate the process and impact of an original musical created by our Theatre and Religious Studies departments <img src="images/externallink-dark.svg"></a>,
                    I helped amplify the reach of the show to a wide range of audiences. Included here is a video of me talking about how the project impacted me, created for the WSV site. I also worked as a research intern for the Digital Humanities
                    Initiative, where I had my first foray into technical writing. In this role I researched the most effective platform, created guides to be used by students, designed the framework for their final product, and taught the class how to
                    use the tools.</br>
                    </br>
                    I enjoy the opportunity to help others use technology to communicate and visualize what is important to them. As a professional technical writer, I help customers understand and better use our data processing software to gain insights that help their
                    businesses run more smoothly. I am also interested in discovering how technology can be designed for universal accessibility that accommodates all range of user abilities.

                    <p class="caption">My Instagram post of photos of our group, some food, and sights from the annual conference for the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE)</p>
                </div>
                <div style="width:100%;">
                    <p>At Gonzaga, I was the president of the Real Food Challenge (RFC) club, involved with educating students on sustainable food systems and working with our dining services provider to get more ecologically sound, locally grown, fair trade,
                        and humanely raised food at our campus. </br>
                        </br>My passion for food justice started with food a means of communicating culture and celebration, but through RFC it also became a means toward a more just and fair world. Our club presented on our school’s move toward more sustainable
                        food at the AASHE university sustainability conference in 2017 and the Tilth Alliance garden and farming conference in 2018. See Portfolio for the poster I created on our work for the 2018 conference.</br>
                        </br>
                        I love eating and sharing food with others, and I believe food can be a vehicle of change. Food touches so many aspects of our society - the natural environment, the laborers who grow it, the grocers who provide access to it, our personal health, our
                        community traditions. When we’re conscious of and aim for the least harm in each of these areas, we can cultivate not only a better food system, but a more socially just planet.
