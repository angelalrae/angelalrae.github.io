        <h2>Is college tiring or is life tiring?</h2>
        <p>Written April 12, 2018.</p>
        <p class="essay-body">
            &emsp;&emsp;I am happy to report that, since writing the initial essay, I have been back to Safeway only twice and once was only to drop off plastic bags in their recycling collection bin. Instead, I’ve been trying to shop at smaller, community-based
            grocery stores including My Fresh Basket and Main Market Co-op. I will add, though, I only went the Co-op once because I found it intimidating. In general, I like that both stores have a variety of produce options that are not in plastic bags,
            which allows me to use the reusable produce bags I have. I also feel that My Fresh Basket does a good job of labeling what products are local in both the produce and grocery sections. In this way, I hope that I have helped lower my carbon
            footprint by buying food more local to eastern Washington, or at least keeping my money within the Spokane community rather than giving it to large corporations.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;On the other hand, I do not think I am any more conscious of where my food is coming from; if I were to make up an excuse, I’d say that it is simply too time consuming to figure out what foods are in season in Spokane and then
            plan my meals around that, when I can more easily buy the foods I already know how to cook. This, of course, is a pretty flimsy excuse given that I find the time every week to stay on top of the Daily Show, Full Frontal, and Last Week Tonight.
            From what I understand through meetings with LINC Foods through the Real Food Challenge, the main winter crops in Spokane include less flashy things like onions and beets. I think I missed the opportunity to buy LINC’s winter “CSA” box, which
            might’ve helped me eat more local and was a great addition to my diet last fall. While arguably this is the wrong approach, I enjoyed that the box allowed me to eat local produce without having to think about it.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In terms of compost, I did buy a bucket to collect my food waste, which I’ve been using ever since. I have used this for most, but not all of the food waste I’ve produced; one specific example of something I routinely throw
            in the trash is tea bags with the small metal staple that would require me to take the extra step to cut this out. Since collecting my food waste, I’ve been surprised by how little of it I actually produce. I’ve only emptied the bucket once,
            and it contained a good number of food containers, such as paper to-go bowls. Since Spokane incinerates its garbage and produces energy from the heat, putting food waste in the garbage here is probably not as bad as at home, where garbage
            goes to a landfill. It still feels better to know that my food is going to be composted instead of putting it in the trash, but I wonder if it is doing as much good as I hope.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;Additionally, I think I could be doing more to encourage my housemates to also use the compost bin, but I’m also unsure if I’ll be able to continue with this system for much longer. In the long run, it would be beneficial to
            get a municipal yard waste bin for our house, but currently it would take more energy than I have for the task of convincing others to buy into it since my landlord is not on board.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In addition to these two efforts, I also started transitioning to a more vegan, plant-based diet. I believe I wrote about this in a CR, but the idea we touched on in class that if you give up beef but not dairy because
            of concerns about cattle agriculture you are still perpetuating a similar (if not the same) system is what really hit me. Since I was vegetarian for mostly environmental reasons and specifically concerned with fish and beef, it did not make
            sense for me to continue eating dairy cheese and butter, especially given that the former is mostly an extra embellishment and the latter is easily replaced with margarine. Overall, I definitely enjoy calling myself a vegan and the admiration
            others seem to have for it more than I enjoy actually eating a plant-based diet, but I’m still motivated enough by this shallow reason to continue trying to eat vegan (when not an inconvenience to others).
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;My footprint calculations have gone up pretty significantly from 18 tons of CO2/year to 22, according to the Nature Conservancy’s carbon footprint calculator, though the Earth Day calculator gave a slightly more optimistic
            outcome for my Earth Overshoot Day. I’m not sure what this increase in CO2 emissions is from, except that I was probably lazier in some of my calculations this time around. I am hesitant to put too much stock in this though, since the calculator
            asks only how much you spent on each category and ignores choices you might have made to buy more locally, especially in the shopping category.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;There is something about doing these calculators that I dread, but I’m not sure if it’s because they are truly not useful or if I only want to believe that they are not. In general, they are mostly discouraging to me, and I
            frequently try to qualify the results that I receive, as I’ve done above and in my initial footprint essay. To an extent, they might also push me towards paralysis where I feel like the issue is too big for me to do anything about so it is
            not worth doing anything about.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, I’ve made some progress on being aware of my food waste and composting it when convenient. I have not done as much as I could to buy local foods, but I have been working toward a plant-based diet. For me,
            focusing on making small changes like these over time feels more effective than looking at the larger picture of my carbon footprint, which is discouraging to the point where I feel like there is nothing I can do with the amount of energy
            and money that I currently have. I hope that it is in fact college that is tiring and not life, implying that perhaps after I graduate I will be able to do more. After writing this essay, I feel somewhat like curling my body into a ball because
            it feels like whatever I do will never be enough.
