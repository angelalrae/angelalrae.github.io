Each line on the graph, representing one team throughout the season, is colored according to one of the team’s main colors.

To distinguish between the selected team & the other teams, the selected team is drawn in a more opaque stroke (alpha values 255:60) and with a thicker stroke width (2:1). In addition, as you key up and down between teams, adjacent teams have fairly different colors to aid in seeing the change. The changes from Cleveland (navy) to Colorado (purple) to Detroit (navy), and from the Yankees (navy) to Oakland (green) are the least different.

In addition to the name of the team being displayed as the up/down keys are pressed, the team’s final percentage is also displayed.
