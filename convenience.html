        <p class="essay-body">
            &emsp;&emsp;I sat down to write this essay ready to lament the emissions from the number of flights I take from Spokane to San Francisco and back again (now a little better because United has added direct flights, yay!), but to flaunt that I, as a vegetarian,
            limit emissions related to my food. Of course, in class we debunked the myth that rejecting beef while continuing to eat other dairy was an adequate compromise for those concerned with either animal welfare or environmental degradation, so
            I should’ve been somewhat prepared for my reality. Imagine my surprise, when food still tops the list of contributors to my carbon footprint. I consider myself a very food-conscious person: as a member of Gonzaga’s Real Food Challenge, I am
            constantly immersed in trying to increase ecologically-sound, humane, fair, and local food. Perhaps since this is the first time I’ve done one of these assessments since going completely vegetarian, I had hoped it would be making a far greater
            impact.
            <br> &emsp;&emsp;It should’ve come as no surprise though that this would be the case since I make very little effort to buy local products, and obviously my food must travel more than I do. In my defense, I do not eat bananas and avocados,
            because I know that they are never local to the United States or to Washington, respectively. What I do eat, though, is what I am used to and often what is cheaper, rather than what is produced locally. The same is true of many of the goods
            I buy, though I do try to buy recycled and/or recyclable products, I do not often think of the journey they take to get to me.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;This brings me to the first change that I will commit to for this semester: being more intentional about buying local. While I can easily walk the two blocks to Safeway, it is likely more environmentally friendly for me to
            drive a couple miles to the Main Market Co-op or My Fresh Basket, where I could find more local options. The Co-op especially I think will make a large impact on my footprint, allowing me to buy not only local food, but also other local products
            where I might otherwise buy from a national brand at a chain store. Since I usually do my shopping alone anyway, this should be an easy change to make, although likely to be more expensive.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;In the EPA’s survey—where food, goods, and services were not considered—the largest portion of my family’s household was transportation, owing to the fact that my parents own four cars, including the one I have here in
            Spokane, two that are used to commute daily, and one that sits in the driveway and is only driven to keep the battery from dying. As empty-nesters, my parents have a significantly lower household carbon footprint than the U.S. average, but
            this probably means they are less likely to make changes. Talking about transportation emissions seemed to make my mother uncomfortable, probably because she comes from a more conservative family, and because often the changes that need to
            be made are inconvenient and time-inefficient. While my father floated the idea of making the train when we talked, I don’t think he is likely to do this. Although it may be faster than sitting in Bay Area traffic, public transportation often
            is not as fast as driving. When I used to take the bus to my private music lessons in South Hill freshman year, it would take over an hour for me to get only 4 miles away—possibly due more to Spokane’s inefficiency than overall public transit
            inefficiency, but not insignificant. Additionally, both my parents—and to an extent, I as well—see it as a status symbol to be able to drive themselves to and from work, and I do not think they are willing to give up this luxury. For me as
            a college student, there is not often the presumption that I am able to drive myself, but for my parents’ age and economic status, it is more stigmatized.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;While philosophically I think it is easy to say that habit and convenience are not good enough reasons for not changing our ways, in reality this is not so easy to enact. The American dominant culture, at least, tells us that
            the “time is money”/constantly hustling and developing and growing mindset is the only way to achieve a happy, prosperous life. As a result, choices that improve speed and convenience are favored, including driving alone frequently and buying
            cheaper goods from more convenient places. When writing this, I am thinking specifically about one of my roommates who prides herself on being stingy and buying things mostly in bulk, and occasionally likes to tell me how she’s practically
            vegetarian because she’s too cheap to buy meat unless it’s on sale; she also likes to poke fun at me for buying organic food, reusable bags, and used textbooks even when they are more expensive than conventional options. Since we live in society
            and not a vacuum, we must either conform to norms against our morals or deal with the stigma associated with taking the bus or train, being vegan, buying more expensive goods, and other environmentally conscious acts.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;Having grown up with municipal compost available since middle school, adjusting to college also meant adjusting to a lack of availability of composting. I contacted my landlord, Jerry, about a month ago asking him if it
            would be possible to get a municipal yard waste/compost bin for the set of townhouses at which I live. With four houses of six people (24 total) and a monthly cost of only $17, I figured he would not ask us to pay for it and I told him about
            my plan to get buckets for each of the houses as to not attract flies/bugs inside. I also told him that a friend who lived only a couple blocks away has a bin and with it, their house produces significantly little garbage. Jerry was hesitant
            because our houses produce very little yard waste, and he suggested instead that we (I and whoever I could get to agree to it) pay for it until we could prove to him that it cut back on trash costs, at which point he would consider chipping
            in. He also suggested that I spend my Monday mornings going through all the trash produced by the four houses and taking out the recyclables before the garbage truck comes by, since that would also help protect the earth without him having
            to do anything. I wrote a letter to the other houses explaining the benefits of composting and how cheap it could be if a lot of people were in, but when I didn’t hear back from people I lost my drive and gave up.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;This brings me to the second change I will commit to this semester: composting all my food waste. The same friend who lives a few blocks away has mentioned that she would be totally okay with me bringing my food waste to her
            bin to be composted, so I will finally take her up on this. My plan is to get a big 5-gallon paint bucket to keep outside our front door to fill with our house’s food waste and take it to her bin when needed. I will probably be driving it
            over, but still avoiding some excess waste. In addition to this, I will follow the lead of my father, who brings a plastic bag with him to work so he doesn’t have to throw his daily apple core and paper coffee cup into the trash. (Aside: I
            have encouraged him to get a reusable coffee mug, which he agreed was a good idea, but he has yet to do so.) In this way, I hope to reduce the amount of waste I produce, which will have a positive effect on human health and ecological biodiversity.
            <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;As expected, the results of these assessments have shown that focusing on local products, especially food, is an effective way to decrease the amount of carbon emissions tied to oneself. Often in working with the Real Food
            Challenge, we get concerned that although we have a relatively high percentage of local produce, the other three categories (humane, fair, and ecologically-sound) are neglected by our efforts. It is affirming to know that local has such an
            important impact on the environment, so by buying local we are supporting both the ecology and the local economy. How amazing it is to think that while we are pushing for humane and local meat, this will also bring down the carbon footprint
            of our school’s food system.
            <br>&emsp;&emsp;In conclusion, I vow to be more aware of the ecological impact of my personal food and eating habits. It was rather subconscious that I chose both my goals around food, but not surprising considering the personal connection
            I feel toward growing, cooking, and eating food. Seeing the impact that food plays in my carbon footprint will motivate me to aim for better food practices, which will likely resonate out into other parts of my life. As we like to stress in
            the Real Food Challenge, focusing on food justice ripples out into touching many parts of justice—social, environmental, and health for producers, consumers, communities, and the earth.
